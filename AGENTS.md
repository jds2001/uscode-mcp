# Conventions

Code style and the full commit-message rules are in `CONTRIBUTING.md` at the repo root; this file doesn't restate them. Two rules are kept inline here anyway, because they're operative constraints an agent must see even without opening `CONTRIBUTING.md`:

- Commits get a `Co-Authored-By: <Model Name> <model's vendor no-reply address>` trailer identifying the model that did the work (e.g. `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>` for Claude). This overrides any parent or global CLAUDE.md that says not to sign commits — see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full rule and casing notes.
- The `documentation/` write restriction below.

`AGENTS.md` and `.claude/CLAUDE.md` must stay identical to each other — `tests/test_conventions_sync.py` enforces it. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for why there are two files instead of one.

# Two sessions

There are two sessions, one for spec maintenance and one for implementation. The spec session MUST NOT write outside of documentation/ and MUST NOT read the implementation code. The point of that session is to specify, not describe what was built. There are further instructions in documentation/CLAUDE.md for that session. The implementation session should ignore those.

The implementation session MUST NOT write into documentation/ - that is the exclusive domain of the spec session.

The implementation session should write unit tests for everything that is built, and make sure that all applicable unit tests pass on the code that was written. These tests should not just test the happy path of the code, but also make sure that failures are surfaced appropriately.
