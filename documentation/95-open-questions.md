# Open questions

Q1–Q5 are answered — rulings in `96-rulings.md`. E1, E2, E7, E8 and most of E4 were run 2026-08-29; outcomes in `90-observations.md` O10–O19. Numbering continues.

## For the maintainer

Q6. v2 candidates deferred by R1/R2, parked here so they aren't lost: (a) a `N Stat. M` citation resolver that returns a GovInfo STATUTE pointer without ingesting anything; (b) a higher-recall PLAW→USC join — the package-summary `references` array demonstrably beats the `uscodecitation` search field (25/33 sampled recall, O21), and OLRC classification tables sit above both; (c) OLRC release points for current-text fetch-by-citation without an index. None are v1. Additions from later measurements: (d) the bulkdata COMPS repository (Statute Compilations in USLM — certain laws maintained as amended, O26) as a possible laws-as-amended source. No maintainer action needed until a v2 conversation starts.

Q7. E2E test harness — **green-lit 2026-08-30, now active spec work.** The harness drives the server through a real consumer model and verifies behavior from the R8 traces (the congressMCP pattern; Q7a confirmed traces are MCP-level). The maintainer has congressMCP examples to share — more than fit in conversation. Requirements questions below, for inline answers; the congressMCP material can be pasted under Q7f or dropped anywhere in `documentation/` and pointed to.

Q7b. What does the harness assert against a trace? Candidates, pick/rank/add: outcome-taxonomy correctness (zero-hit vs upstream-error vs rate-limited never collapsed), provenance completeness on text payloads (currentthrough, edition, links), truncation markers present whenever text was windowed, disambiguation totals (count vs capped list), secret hygiene (no key material anywhere in a trace), tool-selection sanity (did the consumer model reach the right tool for the prompt).

All of the above. We obviously can't hit a rate limit ((36,000/hr) with one consumer driving it though. The important thing is the non-vacuity of the error envelope (errors returned as errors, zero hits returned as zero hits, preferably diagnosable to the consumer - what we do with the word chomping, and all error responses are structured responses, not prose)

As we run across other things that trip up consumers. they cam be added. With congressMCP, we were writing the indexer - we  get the full text of a bill and index it using SQLite + FTS5 (what we get there may be 1100 page bills in XML, so returning an entire bill or even a TOC is a failure that pollutes a models context window, indexing and retrieval is REQUIRED). Here, we don't have anything so complicated and dangerous (yet) so the completeness probably doesn't matter as much. I'll paste the format of the prompts below, and some of the below questions will answer more.

Q7c. Live model per run, recorded-session replay, or record-then-replay (live run captures a golden trace, CI replays it)? The non-vacuity rule pushes toward at least periodic live runs — replay of a recorded session is itself a fixture once recorded.

Live model per run, scored by either/both of a human and the spec session to fill in gaps. This is manually run on high-risk changes and perhaps prior to release. It's expensive to run, so minimal runs are necessary. The prompts are designed to be adveserial, excercising known failrue points in the tools. 

Q7d. Which consumer model(s), driven how (Claude via API tool-runner, Claude Code headless, something else), and what prompt set — hand-written scenarios, or derived from the spec's measured cases (17 U.S.C. 107, 42 U.S.C. 2210 note, Pub. L. 118-31, the appendix Rule 9 ambiguity, a known zero-hit)?

The congressMCP model is Claude Code headless, with all web fetch tools disabled so that we have attributable runs to either the models priors or the tool. Nothing else should be available to it other than the tools and priors. No memory, no dislsoure that you are a developer or that it is being debugged (the model will be more careful if it knows).

For cross-veddor cells, Codex CLI. One thing that we found in the congressMCP development is that ChatGPT authentication to Codex does not allow you to disable web fetching (though we should run our own experiment to validate that, I think we may have found the way to do it AFTER we already went the native API route). If the experiment holds up, the harness MUST refuse to run if API key authentication is not in use. This results in billing separately from the ChatGPT account, but there's no way around it if the experiment holds.

Q7e. Confirm the ownership split: harness code lives implementation-side; the verification contract — what a conforming trace looks like, pass/fail criteria — lives here in the spec. And is the harness a CI gate, an opt-in marker (the integration-marker idea from the v1 report), or manual-only?

Hanress code lives in implementation, 

Q7f. congressMCP examples land here.

The prompts (obviously these exact prompts won't apply here, but you get the format):

{
  "_about": "§17 end-to-end prompt manifest. The harness executes these verbatim and records results BESIDE the pinned criteria; it never scores. Pinning `pass`/`fail` here, before the run, is §17's preregistration-of-scoring rule -- so do not edit a criterion after seeing a result.",
  "_substitution_rule": "§17 requires concrete phrases substituted from harness output, and requires every prompt asserting a document property to cite its evidence. A3 and B3 were both invalidated by phrases written from plausibility rather than from the record.

  "_cells_note": "Per the §17 driver-axis ruling (2026-08-18): a cell is identified by (driver, model, effort, surface, context condition, prompt variant). `role` is the short matrix role -- floor/ceiling/capability-floor/isolation are Claude-matrix roles, and every codex cell carries a cross-vendor role, so a codex result can never silently substitute for a Claude gate cell. Knobs are recorded in the driver's native vocabulary, verbatim, never translated: Claude cells carry `thinking`, codex cells carry `reasoning_effort`, and no mapping between the two scales exists or is defensible. Model ids and knobs are operator parameters defaulting to this table. Cache axis (§17-PR2, 2026-08-22): every cell carries `cache: {mode, packages?}` -- absent means `cold` (a fresh, empty CONGRESSMCP_CACHE_DIR per invocation, created by the harness; the default, and required for every timing-sensitive cell); `warm` names packages from `documents` that the harness pre-warms by direct server-side calls before the prompt, never by a model turn.

## Run — see observations

E5's remainder ran 2026-08-29 (O22): `X-Api-Key` header auth confirmed with a 401 no-credential control — and promoted from alternative to the only permitted transport by R7.

E9 ran 2026-08-29 (protocol in commit a455a66, outcome O21): 25/33 recall, recency hypothesis falsified — the gap is structural. Q6(b) is now measured and awaits a maintainer ruling on whether a v2 references-array-based join gets designed.

## Preregistered experiments

None pending. E1–E10 have all run; outcomes are O10–O26 (see `90-observations.md`). New experiments get preregistered here before running, per convention.

Closed 2026-08-30: E3 — `resultLevel:"package"` zero-hits granule-field queries, a hazard not a tool (O23). E4a — PLAW USLM boundary at the 113th Congress (O25). E6 — bulkdata has no USCODE repository; GovInfo's USCODE format story is complete as measured (O26). E10 — direct appendix citation forms exist; the appendix redirect upgraded to direct resolution with the redirect demoted to zero-hit fallback (O24).
